<p style='width: 600px; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.2em;'>PREFACE</p>
<p style='width: 600px;'>The pleasure of giving to the public this volume has
been brought about by the publication of the author&#8217;s work entitled,
&quot;Boy Wanted,&quot; which he presented as &quot;a book of cheerful counsel
to his young friends and such of the seniors as are not too old to accept a bit
of friendly admonition.&quot;</p>
<p style='width: 600px;'>The warm welcome accorded that book, and the many
requests it has called forth for a similar companion volume for girls, has
prompted the author to prepare the series of papers offered herewith, with the
hope that they, too, may find as many youthful friends (between the ages of
seven and seventy) awaiting them.</p>
<p style='width: 600px;'>In the present volume, as in &quot;Boy Wanted,&quot;
the fine prose thoughts are selected from the writings of a very large number
of the world&#8217;s foremost teachers and philosophers of all times, while the
author, with a due sense of modesty, lays claim to all such examples of
versification as are to be found within this book.</p>
<p style='width: 600px;'>In these days when the women of the world, with such
splendid success, are writing books for the moral guidance and spiritual uplift
of the men and youth of every land, an author need not feel called upon to
apologize when he presumes to address his remarks to readers of the opposite
sex, as did John Ruskin, to such fine purpose, in the &quot;Pearls for Young
Ladies.&quot;</p>
<p style='width: 600px;'>Since his own mother, wife, sisters, daughters and
many of his best friends belong to the feminine half of humanity, any man who
is a careful observer, a logical reasoner, and an adequate writer ought to be
able to say something of worth and interest to the women and girls to whom he
is permitted to address himself. If in this volume the author is able to impart
to others, in a small degree, the beneficent influence he has received through
the splendid precepts and noble examples of the women to whom he owes so much,
he will deem himself grandly rewarded for the labor of love herein set
forth.</p>
<p style='width: 600px;'>Nor is the author unconscious of the great purpose
that should underlie the writing of a series of papers designed to direct the
daughters of our land toward the greatest factor in the making and the
perpetuity of a nation&#8212;a noble and beautiful womanhood. For observation
has taught the world that&#8212;</p>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What mothers, wives and sisters make them.<br /></p>

life.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Thoreau.</span></span>Yes,
my good girl, I am very glad that we are to have the opportunity to enjoy a
friendly chat through the medium of the printed page, with its many tongues of
type.</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>It is faith in something and enthusiasm for something
that makes a life worth looking at.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Oliver Wendell Holmes.</span></span> Just here I
have a favor to ask of you, and that is that you will consent to let us talk
chiefly about yourself and the manner in which you are going to live all the
golden to-morrows that are awaiting you.</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>The habit of viewing things cheerfully, and of
thinking about life hopefully, may be made to grow up in us like any other
habit.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Smiles.</span></span> In a
discussion of the topics which are to follow, it will be well for you to
understand that there has never been a period in the world&#8217;s history when
a girl was of more importance than she is just now. Indeed, many close
observers and clear thinkers are of the opinion that there <span class=
'pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span> never has been a
time when a girl was of <span class='sidenote'>A laugh is worth a hundred
groans in any state of the market.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Charles Lamb</span>.</span> quite so much importance
as she is to-day.</p>
<p>Some of our most able writers tell us that we are just on the threshold of
&quot;the women&#8217;s century,&quot; and that the great advance the world is
to witness in the forthcoming years is to be largely inspired by, and redound
to the glory of, the women of the earth.</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>The old days never come again, because they would be
getting in the way of the new, better days whose turn it is.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>George MacDonald</span>.</span> Come what will, the
future is sufficiently alluring to cause you to cherish it most fondly and to
determine that you will make the years that are before you as bright and
beautiful and as &quot;worth while&quot; as it is possible for you to do.</p>
<p>It is a glorious privilege to dwell in the very forefront of time, in the
grandest epoch of the world&#8217;s history and to feel that we are permitted
to be observers of, and if it may so be, active participants in, the
fascinating events that are occurring all about us.</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>The man who has learned to take things as they come,
and to let go as they depart, has mastered one of the arts of cheerful and
contented living.&#8212;<span style=

achievements that are being encompassed in every field of human endeavor, the
world to-day, needs most, that which the world has ever most needed&#8212;words
helpful and true, hearts kind and tender, hands <span class=
'pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span> willing and
ready to lift the less fortunate over the rough places in the paths of life,
goodness and grace, gentle women and gentlemen.</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>Cheerfulness is the very flower of
health.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Schopenhauer</span>.</span> And so here we find
ourselves, just at this particular spot and at this very moment, with all of
the days, months, years&#8212;yes, the whole of eternity&#8212;still to be
lived!</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>There are people who do not know how to waste their
time alone, and hence become the scourge of busy people.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>De Bonald.</span></span> At first thought it seems
like a great problem, does this having to decide how we are going to live out
all the great future that is before us. Yet, when we come to think it over, we
see that it is not so difficult after all; for, fortunate mortals that we are,
we shall never have to live it but one moment at a time. And, better still,
that one moment is always to be the one that is right here and just now where
we can see it and study it and shape it and do with it as we will.</p>
<p>Just this minute!</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>Not what has happened to myself to-day, but what has
happened to others through me&#8212;that should be my thought.
&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Frederick Deering
Blake</span>.</span> Surely it will not require a great deal of effort on the
part of any one of us to live the next sixty seconds as they should be lived.
And having lived one moment properly, it ought to be still easier for us to
live the next one as well, and then the next, and the next until, <span class=
'pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span> finally, we
continue to live them rightly, just as a matter of habit.</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>Let us be of good cheer, remembering that the
misfortunes hardest to bear are those which never come.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Lowell</span>.</span> When we come to understand
clearly that time is the thing of which lives are made, and that time is
divided into a certain number of units, we can then pretty closely figure out,
by simple processes in arithmetic, how much life is going to be worth to
us.</p>
<p>What we are doing this minute, multiplied by sixty, tells us what we are
likely to accomplish in an hour.</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>The highest luxury of which the human mind is
sensible is to call smiles upon the face of misery.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Anonymous</span>.</span> What we do in an hour,
multiplied by the number of working hours in every twenty-four, tells us what
we may expect to achieve in a day.</p>
<p>What we do in a day, multiplied by three hundred and sixty-five, shows us
what it is probable we shall accomplish in a year.</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>He who is plenteously provided for from within, needs
but little from without.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Goethe</span>.</span> What we do in a year, when
multiplied by the number of years of youth and health and strength, we have
reason to believe are yet before us, sets forth the result we may hope to
secure in a lifetime. For it is not hard for us to comprehend that.
<span class='sidenote'>Each day should be distinguished by at least one
particular act of love.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Lavater</span>.</span> <span class=

<p class='poetry'>If, ever, while this minute&#8217;s
here,<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We use it circumspectly,<br />
We&#8217;ll live this hour, this day, this year,<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yes, all our lives, correctly.</p>
<p>As the work of the builder is preceded by the plans of the architect, so the
deeds we do in life are preceded by the thoughts we think. The thought is the
plan; the deed is the structure.</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>Every person is responsible for all the good within
the scope of his abilities, and for no more; and none can tell whose sphere is
the largest.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Gail
Hamilton.</span></span> &quot;As the twig is bent the tree is inclined.&quot;
Wordsworth tells us: &quot;The child is father of the man.&quot; Which means,
also, that the child is mother of the woman. That which we dream to-day we may
do to-morrow. The toys of childhood become the tools of our maturer years.</p>
<p>So it follows that an important part of the work and occupation of
one&#8217;s early years should be to learn to have right thoughts, which, later
on in life, are to become right actions.</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>Work is the very salt of life, not only preserving it
from decay, but also giving it tone and flavor.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Hugh Black</span>.</span> The pleasant, helpful girl
is most likely to become the pleasant, helpful woman. The seed that is sown in
the springtime of life determines the character of the harvest that must be
reaped in the autumn. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name=

<p><span class='sidenote'>Treat your friends for what you know them to be.
Regard no surfaces. Consider not what they did, but what they
intended.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Thoreau</span>.</span>
The cultivation of the right point of view means so much in determining
one&#8217;s attitude toward all that the years may bring. Three centuries ago
it was written: &quot;What is one man&#8217;s poison is another&#8217;s meat or
drink.&quot; So there are many things in life that bring pleasure to some and
distress to others.</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>Work! It is the sole law of the
world.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Emile Zola</span>.</span>
There is a beautiful little story about a shepherd boy who was keeping his
sheep in a flowery meadow, and because his heart was happy, he sang so loudly
that the surrounding hills echoed back his song. One morning the king, who was
out hunting, spoke to him and said: &quot;Why are you so happy, my
boy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why should I not be happy?&quot; answered the boy. &quot;Our king is
not richer than I.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed,&quot; said the king, &quot;pray tell me of your great
possessions.&quot;</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>No lot is so hard, no aspect of things is so grim,
but it relaxes before a hearty laugh.&#8212; <span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>George S. Merriam</span>.</span> The shepherd boy
answered: &quot;The sun in the bright blue sky shines as brightly upon me as
upon the king. The flowers upon the mountain and the grass in the valley grow
and bloom to gladden my sight as well as his. I would not take a fortune for my
hands; my eyes are of more value than all the precious stones <span class=
'pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span> in the world. I
have food and clothing, too. Am I not, therefore, as rich as the
king?&quot;</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>Concentration is the secret of
strength.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Emerson</span>.</span>
&quot;You are right,&quot; said the king, with a smile, &quot;but your greatest
treasure is your contented heart. Keep it so, and you will always be
happy.&quot;</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>Anybody can do things with an

'font-variant: small-caps'>Patrick Flynn</span>.</span> So much of life&#8217;s
happiness depends upon one&#8217;s immediate surroundings that wherever it is a
matter of choice they should be made to conform as nearly as possible to the
thoughts and tastes one wishes to cultivate. As a matter of course but few
persons can have just the surroundings they would like, but it <span class=

to be found in foreign lands, but in the heart itself.&#8212;<span style=

pleasant thinking all of us can make the surroundings we have more likable. We
can, at least, be thoughtful of the character of the friends and companions we
choose to have with us, and it is they who are the most vital and influential
part of our</p>

<p>A smile may be as deep as a well and as wide as a church door; it may be

genuine, it loses its charm and becomes, in fact, much worse than no smile at

quantity. So the only really safe rule is for us not to smile until we feel

They may be compelled to sigh betimes, but amid their sighs are smiles that
drive away the cares. They find sunbeams scattered in the trail of every cloud.
They gather flowers where others see nothing but weeds. They pluck little

opportunity for making others happy. He who is most true to his higher self is
truest to the race. The lamp that shines brightest gives the most light to all
about it. Thoreau says: &quot;To enjoy a thing exclusively is commonly to
exclude yourself from the true enjoyment of life.&quot;</p>

traced upon the former, and most of the successive lines that carve the
furrowed face of age out of the smooth outline of childhood are engraved
directly or indirectly by mind. There is no beautifier of the face like a
beautiful spirit.</p>

wearing a pleasant face, or of smiling honestly and cheerfully, we have an
accomplishment that is worth more than many others that are more pretentious
and more superficial. If to this accomplishment we can add another&#8212;the
ability to speak a pleasant word to those whom we may meet&#8212;we are not to

<p>There is a good, old-fashioned word in the dictionary, the study of which,
with its definition, is well worth our while. <span class='sidenote'>Politeness
is like an air cushion; there may be nothing in it, but it eases the jolts
wonderfully.&#8212; <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>George
Eliot</span>.</span> The word is &quot;Complaisance,&quot; and it is defined as
&quot;the disposition, action, or habit of being agreeable, or conforming to
the views, wishes, or convenience of others; desire or endeavor to please;
courtesy; politeness.&quot;</p>
<p>Complaisance, as it has been truly said, renders a superior amiable, an
equal agreeable, an inferior acceptable. It <span class=

Franklin</span>.</span> sweetens conversation; it produces good-nature and
mutual benevolence; it encourages the timid, soothes the turbulent, humanizes
the fierce, and distinguishes a society of civilized persons from a confusion
of savages.</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>Action may not always bring happiness; but there is
no happiness without action.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Disraeli</span>.</span> Politeness has been defined
as society&#8217;s method of making things run smoothly. True complaisance is a
more intimate quality. It is an impulse to seek points of agreement with
others. A spirit of welcome, whether to strangers, or to new suggestions,
untried pleasures, fresh impressions. It never is satisfied to remain inactive
as long as there is anybody to please or to make more comfortable.</p>
<p>The complaisant person need not be lacking in will, in determination, or
individuality. In fact it is the complaisant <span class='sidenote'>We would

Kempis</span>.</span> person&#8217;s strength of will that holds in check and
harmonizes all the other traits of character and moulds them into a perfectly
balanced disposition.</p>
<p>Complaisance rounds off the sharp corners, chooses softer and gentler words
and makes it easy and pleasant for all to dwell together in unity. And it never
fails to contribute something to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'

<p><span class='sidenote'>What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the
people think.&#8212;<span style=

never amount to much. Battles are not won with flags at half-mast. No, they are
run up to the very tops of their standards and are waved as far toward the
heavens as is possible.</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>Gentle words, quiet words, are, after all, the most
powerful words.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Washington
Gladden.</span></span> If we lack enthusiasm we are almost as certain to fail
of achieving an end as a locomotive engine that lacks steam is of climbing the
grade. Even a listless, lackadaisical spirit may get on all right so long as
the path of life is all on a level or is down grade, but when it comes to
hill-climbing and the real experiences of life that serve to develop character,
it is likely to give up the contest and surrender the prize it might win to
other and more earnest competitors.</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>Aim above morality. Be not simply good; be good for
something.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Thoreau.</span></span>
&quot;If you would get the best results, do your work with enthusiasm as well

can!&quot; says Orison <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name=

man who, as Emerson says, &#8217;hitches his wagon to a star,&#8217; is more
likely to arrive at his goal than the one who trails in the slimy path of the
snail.&quot;</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>Peace! Peace! How sweet the word and tender! Its very

'font-variant: small-caps'>Nathan Haskell Dole.</span></span> Every girl knows
that the girl friends whom she loves best are the ones who are alive to the
world about them and who feel an enthusiasm in the tasks and privileges that
confront them.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm is the breeze that fills the sails and sends the ship gliding
over the happy waves. It is the joy of doing things and of seeing that things
are well done. It gives to work a thoroughness and a delicious zest and to play
a whole-souled, health-giving delight.</p>

sulk if they are left with nothing to do. If all have their work, they have not
only their own joy in creating thought, in making thought into form, in driving
on something to completion, but they have the joy of ministering to the
movement of the whole house, when they feel that <span class='sidenote'>The

living whole. That in itself is sunshine. See how the face lights up, how the
step is quickened, how the whole man or child is a different being from the
weary, aimless, lifeless, complaining being who had no work! It is all the
difference between life and death.&quot;</p>
<p>We <span class='sidenote'>Men talk about the indignity of doing work that is

in tune. Charles Kingsley says: &quot;Thank God every morning when you get up
that you have something to do that day which must be done whether you like it
or not. Being forced to work, and forced to do your best, will breed in you
temperance and self-control, diligence and strength of will, cheerfulness and

and invites to idleness, nature executes her sharpest revenge upon such
infraction of the present order; the idle rich live next door to ruin.&quot;
And Burton puts the case even more strongly when he says: &quot;He or she that

curious to see how the space clears around a man and leaves him room and

Foster</span>.</span> riches do not necessarily have to be associated with
idleness. Riches rightly employed bestow upon the possessors of them the
blessed privilege of being employed in the kind of work where they can serve to
the best advantage and do most for their fellowmen. Indeed, the possession of
riches places upon those who have them the moral necessity and obligation of
doing more and better things in the world than is expected of the ones less

every man according to his needs.&quot; The larger responsibilities are placed

resolved on my purpose, and persisting that I was happy, that the world was
treating me well, I was surprised to find myself lifted up, as it were; my
carriage became more erect, my step lighter, and I had the sensation of

smiling, for I caught myself in the act once or twice. I looked into the faces
of the women I passed and there saw so much trouble and anxiety, discontent,
even to peevishness, that my heart went out to them, and I wished I could

<p>&quot;Arriving at the office, I greeted the book-keeper with some passing
remark, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name=

a pleasant footing for the day; she had caught the reflection. The president of
the company I was employed by was a very busy man and much worried over his
affairs, and at some remark that he made about my work I would ordinarily have
felt quite hurt (being too <span class='sidenote'>The finest qualities of our

should mar its brightness, so replied to him cheerfully. His brow cleared, and
there was another pleasant footing established, and so throughout the day I
went, allowing no cloud to spoil its beauty for me or others about me. At the

congeniality and warm friendship. People will meet you half-way if you will
take the trouble to go that far.</p>
<p>&quot;So, my sisters, if you think the world is not treating you kindly
don&#8217;t delay a day, but say to yourselves: &#8217;I am going to keep young

will be happy and make others happy, or whether we shall be distressed and

our habit of looking at things. One of our careful students of human attributes
tells us&#8212;and the truth of which we all know&#8212;&quot;that there is
nothing surer than that we go and grow in just that direction in which our mind
is most firmly fixed. Hoarding money absorbs the whole time and mind of the
miser; how to scatter it is the chief thought of the spendthrift. Our daily

Strode.</span></span> actions, and their result on our lives, are the effect of
a cause&#8212;and that cause is invariably our previous thought. What you think
most of to-day will be most likely what you will repeat to-morrow. Therefore it
is of the utmost <span class='sidenote'>It is impossible to estimate the power

face Joy shines farthest out to sea.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Anonymous.</span></span> importance that we begin to
think as deeply as possible on just those things that build us up. Half the
work is already done if we can only concentrate our minds on that which we
desire to do. It is the mind that drags us either up or down. Where that leads
we follow.</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>No one in this world of ours ever became great by
echoing the voice of another, repeating what that other has
said.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>J. C. Van

mind in one direction and then take the opposite road ourselves. Therefore,
whether we are moving upward or downward in the scale of life depends on
whether we are thinking up or thinking <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id=

'font-variant: small-caps'>Earl M. Pratt</span>.</span> satisfaction. Thought
impels action, action forms habit, and habit rules our lives. So that no matter
what direction we may wish to take, up or down, it is only necessary for us to
fix our mind in the desired direction.&quot;</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>Let us then, be what we are, speak what we think, and

SOME EVERY-DAY VIRTUES</span></p>
<p>I would rather be right than president!&quot; <span class='sidenote'>Each,
whatever his estate, in his own unconscious breast bears the talisman of
fate.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>John Townsend
Trowbridge</span>.</span></p>
<p>At first thought those words seem to be the declaration of an unusually
upright and conscientious person. But let us study them a little more deeply
and closely.</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>When a man has not a good reason for doing a thing,
he has one good reason for letting it alone.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Thomas Scott</span>.</span> The desire to do right
and to deserve the approbation of all good people is very strong in every human
breast. Not until a man has lost his moral sense of values would he trade his
integrity and self-respect for any other gift the world could offer. This being
true, who among us would care to be president if in order to occupy that
exalted position he must be obviously in the wrong?</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>Once a body laughs he cannot be angry
more.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>James M.
Barrie</span>.</span> Thus we see that after all is said and done, the one
great prize for which we all aspire is the love and good will of our friends
and of the world. For no matter <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'
name='page_66'></a>66</span> <span class='sidenote'>Success is usually the
result of a sharpened sense of what is wanted.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Frank Moore Colby.</span></span> how much of wealth
and fame may come to us, without the love and respect of our fellow beings we
must ever remain poor and friendless.</p>
<p>He is the richest who deserves the most friends. Wealth is a matter of the
<span class='sidenote'>He that falls in love with himself, will have no
rivals.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Benjamin
Franklin.</span></span> heart and not of the pocket. A thousand slaves piling
up wealth for their master cannot make him rich. It is not that which others do
for us that makes us possessors of great wealth, but that which we do for
others. All true riches are self made. Only when the hand and the heart are put
into one&#8217;s work does it yield a lasting worth. In the final true analysis
the picture forever belongs to the painter who paints it; the poem to the poet
who writes it; the loaf of bread to the toiler who earns it. Wealth may acquire
these things but it cannot own them.</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>A sinful heart makes a feeble
hand.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Walter Scott.</span></span>
Therefore the true value of character is something that each must achieve for
himself. It cannot be bought; it cannot be bequeathed to us; it must be earned
by each individual who would possess it. Hence it is that these great riches
may be acquired by all who desire to possess them. <span class=
'pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>Look within, for you have a lasting foundation of
happiness at home that will always bubble up if you will but dig for
it.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Marcus Aurelius
Antoninus.</span></span> Where are they to be found? Right here.</p>
<p>When may we obtain them? Right now.</p>
<p>Do you care to learn the only way in which you can come into possession of
them? &quot;Whoever you are&#8212;wise or foolish, rich or poor,&quot; says
Rebecca Harding Davis, &quot;God sent you into His <span class='sidenote'>To a
friend&#8217;s house the road is never long.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Danish Proverb.</span></span> world, as He sent
every other human being, to help the men and women in it, to make them happier
and better. If you do not do that, no matter what your powers may be, you are
mere lumber, a worthless bit of world&#8217;s furniture. A Stradivarius, if it
hangs dusty and dumb upon the wall, is not of as much real value as a kitchen
poker which is used.&quot;</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>Honest toil is holy service; faithful work is praise
and prayer.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Henry Van
Dyke.</span></span> So we learn that it is the fine practical spirit, content
and willing to do the humble things which are possible of achievement that is
doing most to lift the world to a higher and better plane. &quot;Have you never
met humble men and <span class='sidenote'>Give me the toiler&#8217;s joy who
has seen the sunlight burst on the distant turrets in the land of his
desire.&#8212; <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Muriel

knew little, yet who had a certain fascination as of fineness lurking about
them? Know them, and you are likely to find them persons who have put so

painting walls&#8212;have put their ideals so long, so constantly, so lovingly
into that common work of theirs, that finally these qualities have come to
permeate not their work only, but so much of their being, that they are
fine-fibred within, even if on the outside the rough bark clings.&quot;</p>
<p>If we are wisely introspective, we must reach the conclusion that humble
though we may be, we are after all, a <span class='sidenote'>A tart temper
never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only edged tool that grows
keener with constant use.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Washington Irving.</span></span> component part of
the great expression of being, and that we are well worth while. Then if we are
worth while, it follows that all we do is worth while, for each of us is, in
the end, the sum of all the things he has done. Once we have this idea that
everything stands for something more than the mere thing itself&#8212;that it
is correlated in its influences with all the other things that we and all
others are doing, we shall invest all our tasks, little and big, with more of
purpose and importance. Emerson says:</p>
<p>&quot;There is no end to the sufficiency of character. It can afford to
wait; it can <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name=

Holmes.</span></span> do without what it calls success; it cannot but succeed.
To a well-principled man existence is victory. He defends himself against
failure in his main design by making every inch of the road to it pleasant.
There is no trifle and no obscurity to him: he feels the immensity of the chain
whose last link he holds in his hand, and is led by it.&quot;</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>When a true genius appears in the world you may know
him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against
him.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Jonathan Swift.</span></span>
Perhaps no other every-day virtue counts for so much in the general welfare of
the world as the adapting of one&#8217;s self to, and the making the most of,
one&#8217;s immediate surroundings. It is in the hundreds of little, unrecorded
deeds of kindness and goodness that we lay the foundations of character. And
because these humble lives, that mean so much to the other humble lives with
which they <span class='sidenote'>What we have got to do is to keep up our

into touch, are never specifically named and shouted by the multitudinous
tongues of type, that many fail to see in them the elements of true and noble
achievement with which they are crowned. &quot;The most inspiring tales,&quot;
it has been truly said, &quot;are those that have not been written; the most
heroic deeds are those that have not been told; the world&#8217;s greatest
successes have been <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name=

men&#8217;s hearts, the noblest heroes are the countless thousands who have
struggled and triumphed, rising on stepping-stones of their dead selves to
higher things.&quot;</p>
<p>Since it is these humbler every-day virtues that one is called upon oftenest
to exercise, or to neglect, it is apparent <span class='sidenote'>Duty is the
sublimest word in the English language.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Gen. Robert E. Lee.</span></span> that the one who
possesses the most of them and who cultivates them the most earnestly has the
greatest number of opportunities of winning the admiration of others. It is of
a girl possessing this fine adaptability to the world&#8217;s workaday
surroundings that &quot;Amber&quot; draws this pen-picture: &quot;Shall I tell

and ready for frolic. She does not depend upon a servant to do what she can do
for herself. She is considerate toward all who serve her. She is reverent to
the old and thoughtful of the feeble. She never criticises when criticism can
wound, and she is ready with a helpful, loving word for every one. Sometimes
she has no father, or her parents are too poor to support her. Then she goes
out and earns her living by whatever her hands find to do. She clerks in a
store, or she counts out change at a cashier&#8217;s desk, or she teaches
school, or she clicks a typewriter, or rather a telegrapher&#8217;s key, but

or condemn her. If she is quick to be courteous, unselfish, gentle and retiring

girl any more than you can mistake the sunshine that follows the rain or the
lark that springs from the hawthorne hedge. All things that are blooming and
sweet attend her! The earth is better for her passing through it and heaven
will be fairer for her habitation therein.&quot;</p>
<p>How fortunate it is for us who would practice these little every-day virtues
that we do not have to wait for some noted person at some remote time to tell
the world that we are striving in our own humble way to be kind and thoughtful.
There is some one within the sound of our voice and within the reach of our
hand who will be glad to testify to our goodness.</p>

<p>The extent to which we may feel a sense of peaceful satisfaction at the end

relations with whatever the surrounding conditions may chance to be. There is
no irritation, no clash of interests, no lack of organization for performing to
the best of one&#8217;s ability the duties of the moment, as they present
themselves for consideration. Nothing is so conducive to success as to be able,
calmly and patiently, to do to the best of one&#8217;s ability the tasks that

have been a pleasant coming together of kindly congenial spirits is made
painful and unprofitable because some one lacked the patience and forbearance

been promptly dismissed from the mind and the heart, or better still, which
never should have been permitted to enter. As has been truly observed,

small means; to seek elegance rather than luxury; and refinement rather than

real sorrows seldom crush them. Souls have in them a wonderful capacity for

who is given to having &quot;the blues&quot; often darkens a home that would

that when a servant is employed the whole household <span class=

tidy, industrious, moral, gentle, and, above all, good natured in her attitude

holds her position by accident of birth, and that if her family were not
compelled to keep her they would not. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id=

an excellent telescope. From childhood Maria had been accustomed to the use of
this instrument, searching out with its aid, the distant sails upon the horizon

astronomy, and carried on an independent series of observations. He taught his
daughter all he knew, and what was more to her advancement, she applied herself
to the study and made as much independent <span class='sidenote'>Work is the

make the most of her immediate surroundings that proved to be the secret of her
world-wide fame in after years when her name was included with those of the
other prominent astronomers of the world. At half past ten of the evening of

to think that she had really made a discovery, she obtained its right ascension
and declination. She then told her father, who gave <span class='sidenote'>One

and her claim to the discovery was duly accepted and ever after stood to her
lasting credit. But had she not been interested in her work and competent to

conclusion that as we regard these attributes in others, so others must regard
them in us.</p>
<p>Nothing is more eloquent than a beautiful face. It is the open sesame to all
our hearts. A sunshiny face melts away all opposition and finds the word
&quot;Welcome&quot; written over the doorways where the face wearing a hard,
unfriendly look sees only the warning, &quot;No Admittance.&quot;</p>

hour.</p>

cheerful, smiling lines in the face that are so quickly and easily

within.</p>
<p>Many centuries ago that wise and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id=

'font-variant: small-caps'>Whittier.</span></span> admirable philosopher,
Epictetus, discovered that &quot;happiness is not in strength, or wealth, or
power; or all three. It lies in ourselves, in true freedom, in the conquest of
every ignoble fear, in perfect self-government, in a power of contentment and
peace, and the even flow of life, even in poverty, exile, disease and the very
valley of the shadow.&quot;</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>What must of necessity be done you can always find

of life and its higher purposes&#8212;Anne Gilchrist&#8212;says: &quot;I used
to think it was great to disregard happiness, to press to a high goal,
careless, disdainful of it. But now I see there is nothing so great as to be
capable of happiness,&#8212;to pluck it out of each moment, <span class=

and buoyant on the angry, menacing, tumultuous waves of life as on those that
glide and glitter under a clear sky; that it is not defeat and wretchedness
which comes out of the storms of adversity, but strength and
calmness.&quot;</p>
<p>The strongest incentive for the cultivation of a merry heart is that it is a
duty as well as a delight. Sydney Smith has very wisely observed that
&quot;mankind is always happier for having been <span class=
'pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span> <span class=

happy; so that if you make them happy now, you may make them happy twenty years
hence by the memory of it.&quot;</p>
<p>True happiness has about it no suggestion of selfishness. The genuinely
happy person is the one who would have all the world to be happy. &quot;Is
there any happiness in the world like the happiness of a disposition made happy
by the happiness of others?&quot; asks Faber. &quot;There is no joy to be
compared with it. The <span class='sidenote'>Every wish is a prayer with
God.&#8212; <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Elizabeth Barrett
Browning.</span></span> luxuries which wealth can buy, the rewards which
ambition can obtain, the pleasures of art and scenery, the abounding sense of
health and the exquisite enjoyment of mental creations are nothing to this pure
and heavenly happiness, where self is drowned in the blessings of
others.&quot;</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>Say not always what you know, but always know what
you say.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Claudius.</span></span>
One of the most heavenly attributes of happiness is that it begets more
happiness not only in ourselves but in others about us. It has in it an uplift
and a strength that enables us to build the stronger to-day against the
distress that would beset us to-morrow.</p>
<p>&quot;Health and happiness&quot; are terms that are so often closely linked
in our speech and in our literature. One is <span class=

'sidenote'>Evil is wrought by want of thought, as well as want of

a synonym for the other. Perhaps the true significance existing between the two
would be more correctly stated were we to reverse the form in which they are
usually set forth and say &quot;happiness and health&quot; instead. All
observers of human nature and its many complex attributes are convinced that
happiness is the <span class='sidenote'>Our greatest glory consists not in
never falling, but in rising every time we fall.&#8212;<span style=

are manifested later in the blood, the tissues, and the organs, under various
pathological names. Good thoughts are the only germicide. We must kill our
resentment and regret, impatience and anxiety. Health will inevitably follow.

<p>Whether we are happy or not depends much on our point of view. The
disposition to look at everything through kind and beautiful eyes makes all the
world more kind and beautiful. If we are gloomy within the whole world appears
likewise. Perhaps the two ways of looking at things could not be better set
forth than in these clever lines by E. J. Hardy:</p>
<p>&quot;How dismal you look!&quot; said a bucket to his companion, as they

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; replied the other, &quot;I was reflecting on the uselessness
of our being filled, for, let us go away never so full, we always come back
empty.&quot;</p>

bucket; &quot;now I enjoy the thought that however empty we come, we always go
away full. Only look <span class='sidenote'>An hour in every day withdrawn from

<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Charles G. Gordon.</span></span> All of
this being true we must early learn to seize upon opportunities for making
others happy if we, ourselves, would get the most and highest enjoyment from
life. &quot;There are gates that swing within your life and mine,&quot; writes
&quot;Amber,&quot; that good woman of sainted memory, &quot;letting in rare
opportunities from day to day, that tarry but a moment and are gone, like
travelers bound for points remote. There is the opportunity to resist the

is up. It won&#8217;t be back this way, either, for opportunities for good are

<p>It is in living not for ourselves alone but for others that we are to find
the larger and truer happiness of life. Says Jenkin Lloyd Jones, &quot;I would
rather <span class='sidenote'>Remember that everybody&#8217;s business in the
social system is to be agreeable.&#8212;<span style=

drawbridge, moat, and portcullis, apart from the community about me, alienated
from my neighbors, unable to share the woes and the joys of those with whom I
divide nature&#8217;s bounty of land and landscape, of air and sky.&quot; And
along this same line of thinking, Charles Hargrove says: &quot;Brother, sister,
your mistake is to live alone in a crowded world, to think of yourself and your
own belongings, and what is the matter with you, instead of <span class=
'pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span> <span class=

trying to realize, what is the fact&#8212;that you are a member of a great
human society, and that your true interests are one with those of the world
which will go on much the same however it fare with you. Live the larger life,
and you will find it the happier.&quot;</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>Be noble! and the nobleness that lies in other men,

of the chief aims of your life and of mine should be to find happiness and to
see to it that others find it as well. And let us not wait to find happiness in
one great offering, but let us discover it whenever and wherever we can. Let us
carefully study our surroundings to see if it is not hiding all about us.
&quot;Very few things,&quot; says Lecky, &quot;contribute so much to the
happiness of <span class='sidenote'>The cheerful live longest in years, and
afterward in our regards.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Bovee</span>.</span> life as a constant realization
of the blessings we enjoy. The difference between a naturally contented nature
and a naturally discontented one is one of the marked differences of innate
temperament, but we can do much to cultivate that habit of dwelling on the
benefits of our lot which converts acquiescence into a more positive
enjoyment.&quot;</p>
<p>Nothing can do more to add to our happiness of mind than to cultivate the
gracious habit of being grateful for joys <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id=

Fields</span>.</span> that come to us and to seek to appreciate the worth of
the beneficent gifts that are ever being showered upon us. We are so apt to
fall into the habit of accepting blessings as a matter of course and of failing
to discover their wonderful value. How many of us, for example, have ever
thoughtfully dwelt upon <span class='sidenote'>Make each goal when reached, a

'font-variant: small-caps'>Browning</span>.</span> the priceless attributes of
the air that is ever and always floating about us. In order that we may have a
truer appreciation of its fine qualities and purposes let us read these words
by Lord Avebury:</p>
<p>&quot;Fresh air, how wonderful it is! It permeates all our body, it bathes
the skin in a medium so delicate that we are not conscious of its presence, and
yet <span class='sidenote'>The world is so full of a number of things,
I&#8217;m sure we should all be as happy as kings.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Robert Louis Stevenson</span>.</span> so strong that
it wafts the odors of flowers and fruit into our rooms, carries our ships over
the seas, the purity of sea and mountain into the heart of our cities. It is
the vehicle of sound, it brings to us the voices of those we love and the sweet
music of nature; it is the great reservoir of the rain which waters the earth,
it softens the heat of day and the cold of night, covers us overhead with a
glorious arch of blue, and lights up the morning and evening skies with fire.
It is so <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name=

gentle and yet so useful, that no wonder Ariel is the most delicate, lovable
and fascinating of all Nature Spirits.&quot;</p>
<p>It is only when we open our eyes to the beauty of the wonders about us that
we see how much there is to contribute to our happiness if we will but open our
hearts and let it come in. What a perpetual exaltation nature will afford us
<span class='sidenote'>If you are acquainted with Happiness, introduce him to

Brooks</span>.</span> when we have cultivated the fine habit of looking upon it
with the welcoming eyes through which Richard Jefferies beholds it: &quot;The
whole time in the open air,&quot; he tells us, &quot;resting at mid-day under
the elms with the ripple of heat flowing through the shadow; at midnight
between the ripe corn and the hawthorne hedge or the white camomile and the
poppy pale in the duskiness, with face <span class='sidenote'>Nor love thy
life, nor hate; but what thou liv&#8217;st, live well; how long or short,
permit to heaven.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Milton</span>.</span> upturned to the thoughtful
heaven. Consider the glory of it, the life above this life to be obtained from
constant presence with the sunlight and the stars.&quot;</p>
<p>So let us cultivate the fine habit of finding joy and of shouting it to our
friends and neighbors. Life seems bright to us when we are really glad of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
<span class='sidenote'>The most wasted of all days is that on which one has not

anything and we let gladness have voice to express itself. George MacDonald
says &quot;a poet is a man who is glad of something and tries to make other
people glad of it, too.&quot; In the possession of this kindly spirit, at
least, we must all strive to be poets.</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>It is impossible to be just if one is not
generous.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Joseph

forbidden to all well-bred, to all rational mortals, namely, their distempers.

thunder stroke, I beseech you, by all the angels, to hold your peace, and not
pollute the morning, to which all the housemates bring serene and pleasant
thoughts, by corruption and groans.&quot;</p>
<p>The fine tonic effect of a bright, happy face smiling across the breakfast
table is known to all the world. Better a feast of corn bread and a cheerful

<p>So I feel very sure that you, my dear young lady, for whom these lines are
written, are never going to appear at the breakfast table with aught other than
a bright cheery face and a pleasant word <span class='sidenote'>How active

<p>&quot;Assume a virtue, if you have it not,&quot; says Shakespeare. While as
a rule it is deemed wrong to assume to possess any virtue that we do not
possess, we may and no doubt should, at times, appear to be happy even though
we may feel more like indulging in lamentations. To come to the breakfast table
enumerating a <span class='sidenote'>Every generous nature desires to make the

imaginary ailments is a most ill-advised thing to do. We should endeavor to
forget our troubles and above all we should be slow to give voice to them so
that thereby they will be multiplied in the minds of others. It has been truly
said that most people who are unhappy are really miserable and bring their
misery to others because they allow the failures and discomforts to speak the
first word in their souls. For misery is voluble and the little discomforts
will turn us into their continual mouthpieces if we will give them a

displaying the flag of distress and surrender, the wiser method is to pull our

<p>So let us determine that we will cultivate the happy habit; for indeed even
happiness is largely a habit. &quot;As he thinketh in his heart, so is
he.&quot; If he thinks trouble, he is very likely to find it. If he thinks
sickness, he is <span class='sidenote'>He that composes himself is wiser than

countless worlds that crowd its path; <span class='sidenote'>If I can stop one

Therefore let it be determined between us, right here and now, that come what
may, we shall each of us endeavor to keep a merry heart and a pleasant face. As
we love to see a happy expression on the faces of our parents, brothers,
sisters and friends, so must they enjoy seeing a pleasant look overspreading
our <span class='sidenote'>Wise, cultivated, genial conversation is the best
flower of civilization.&#8212;<span style=

GOLDEN HABITS</span></p>
<p>We often hear <span class='sidenote'>I think that there is success in all
honest endeavor, and that there is some victory gained in every gallant
struggle that is made.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Dickens</span>.</span> persons speaking of &quot;the
force of habit&quot; as though it were something to be regretted. &quot;Habit
is second nature,&quot; is a saying that is included among the classic epigrams
of men. That habits do become very strong, all the world has learned, sometimes
to its sorrow and sometimes to its advantage and delight.</p>
<p>For be it known that good habits are just as strong as bad habits and in
that <span class='sidenote'>Every noble work is at first
impossible.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Carlyle</span>.</span>
we should all feel a common joy and a sense of deliverance from wrong
doing.</p>
<p>The fact that a fixed habit is only a matter of long and gradual growth
ought <span class='sidenote'>Truth is a strong thing, let man&#8217;s life be
true.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Browning</span>.</span> to
be very much to our advantage. This very fundamental principle of their
construction should result in giving us very many more good habits than bad
habits. This happy conclusion is based on the supposition that while many of

is possible we might, in some unguarded moment, do a wrong act, it is unlikely
we could repeat the error so often and so long as to make the questionable
action become a fixed habit.</p>
<p>The doing of a wrong thing should result in convincing us, on sober second
<span class='sidenote'>Pass no day idly; youth does not
return.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Chinese
Proverb</span>.</span> thought, that it was a mistake on our part to have
permitted ourselves to have been led into uncertain, unhappy paths and we would
then and there reinforce our moral strength and our determination that the
wrong should not occur again.</p>
<p>In doing right things, the conditions are quite reversed. Every good deed
inspires us to still greater determination to do more of the same kind. Wrong

thoughtlessness when one&#8217;s conscience, one&#8217;s higher and better
self, is momentarily off guard. Our good acts are performed with a full and
proud realization of what we are doing and are followed by a grateful sense of
retrospective pleasure, after they have been done.</p>

walking bundles of habits, they would give more heed to their conduct while in
the plastic state. Nothing we ever do is, in strict scientific literateness,
wiped out.&quot; One of our latter day philosophers tells us that
&quot;happiness is a matter of habit; and you had better gather it fresh every
day or you will never get it at all.&quot;</p>
<p>In speaking of the success he had achieved in life, Charles Dickens said:
&quot;I have been very fortunate in worldly matters; many men have worked much

well; but I never could have done what I have done, without the habits of
punctuality, order, and diligence, without the determination to concentrate
myself on one object at a time, no matter how quickly its successor should come
upon its heels.&quot;</p>
<p>When we come to study carefully the full meaning of the word
&quot;habit&quot; we find it to be a very comprehensive term. In the sense in
which it is here employed <span class='sidenote'>The truest lives are those
that are cut rose-diamond-fashion, with many facets answering to the
many-planed aspects of the world about them.&#8212;<span style=

condition, which by repetition has become easy, spontaneous or even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
unconscious.&quot; From this definition it is easy to deduce the conclusion
that one&#8217;s habits are in fact one&#8217;s manners, one&#8217;s
principles, one&#8217;s mode of conduct; and a careful consideration of the

Sir John Lubbock has said: &quot;I cannot, however, but think that the world
would be better and brighter if our teachers would dwell on the duty of
Happiness, as well as the happiness of Duty, for we <span class=

<p>Surely we cannot include among good habits the habit of making those about
us unhappy. Hence it is that they who are careless of the state of mind into

it is but simple kindness to allow our friends to sympathize in the great
griefs that may overtake us, it is not kindness for us to be forever stirring

extreme is more or <span class='sidenote'>By wisdom wealth is won; but riches

'font-variant: small-caps'>Bayard Taylor</span>.</span> less absurd and
unwarranted. Perhaps, as a rule, we thrust our troubles quite too willingly
upon others. On the other hand, some of the peoples of the Orient we deem to be
so ludicrously polite in matters of this nature as to almost arouse our
mirth.</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>It is surely better to pardon too much than to
condemn too much.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>George
Eliot.</span></span> An English writer in speaking of the Japanese says:

guest in the home might <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name=

striking contrast with the weeping and wailing, the mourning streamers, the

hearses with which we struggle to stir the envy, if not the hearts of all
beholders!&quot;</p>
<p>In Japan, so we are told, manners are included in the public teaching of
morality. Among our western peoples our public school boys would deem it
strange <span class='sidenote'>It is not the result of our acts that makes them
brave and noble, but the acts themselves and the unselfish love that moved us
to do them.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>R. L.
Stevenson.</span></span> if a master gave them an hour&#8217;s instruction in
the correct manner of behaving toward their father and mother or sisters. Yet
such knowledge might be urgently needed and do good here as it does in Japan
where it is counted the most vital instruction of all. Step by step the
Japanese child is led along the course of behavior, learning how to stand up,
sit down, bow, hang up its hat, and how to think of its parents, brothers and
sisters, and of its country. Later on these lessons are repeated with
illustrations from short stories, and still later by incidents from actual
history and the lives of great men of all <span class='sidenote'>Use thy youth
so that thou mayest have comfort to remember it when it hath forsaken
thee.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Walter
Raleigh</span>.</span> countries. Before the end of the course of instruction
is reached all manner of virtues and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id=
'page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span> points of behavior have been
introduced, such as patriotism, cleanliness, and (especially in the case of
girls) the proper way of advancing and retiring, offering and accepting things,
sleeping and eating, visiting, congratulating and condoling, mourning and
holding public meetings. So the school course continues <span class=
'sidenote'>It is easy to condemn; it is better to pity.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Abbott</span>.</span> from year to year, the
elementary school course lasting four years and the secondary course four years
more, and leading the boys and girls up to the study of benevolence, their duty
to ancestors, to other people&#8217;s property, other people&#8217;s honor,
other people&#8217;s freedom, and, finally, to self-discipline, modesty,
dignity, dress, labor, the treatment of animals, and the due relations of men
and women, both of whom are to be regarded equally as &quot;lords&quot; of
creation. From end to end of the long course of training, behavior rather than
knowledge is insisted upon, even down to the tiniest detail of what our good
great-grandmothers valued as deportment.</p>
<p>To such scrupulous deportment and close attention to minuteness of habit,
<span class='sidenote'>If you don&#8217;t scale the mountain, you can&#8217;t
view the plain.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Chinese
Proverb</span>.</span> some objection can be raised, perhaps. &quot;Some
men&#8217;s behavior,&quot; said Bacon, &quot;is like a verse wherein every
syllable is measured,&quot; and he warned us that manners must be like apparel,
&quot;not too strait or point-device, but free for exercise or <span class=

motion.&quot; However, it is better to err on the side of too much attention to
our manners rather than to be thought careless of our persons and our
behavior.</p>
<p>Civilized peoples cannot help but be concerned with manners, refinement,
good <span class='sidenote'>Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes; some falls are means
the happier to arise.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>William
Shakespeare</span>.</span> breeding, and in a more minute sense, with the forms
of etiquette. It is these things that distinguish civilization from savagery,
and so unmistakably lift the cultured person above the one who does not see fit
to cultivate the grace of gentility.</p>
<p>It has been truly said that we judge our neighbors severely by the breach of
<span class='sidenote'>Be resolutely and faithfully what you are, be humbly
what you aspire to be.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Thoreau</span>.</span>
written or traditional laws,
and choose our society, and even our friends, by the touchstone of courtesy. It
is not an uncommon occurrence for a girl or a boy to win an advantageous
position in life, not by superior mental or physical endowments but by a
graciousness of manners that have smoothed for them the ways that lead to
success.</p>

MacDonald</span>.</span> society seems to have taken the position that we have
a right to expect more from our girls than from our boys in the matter of good
manners. This, however, is not the view held by those who know the true meaning
of good breeding. The <span class='sidenote'>The shadows of our own desires

good and gentle and gracious. They will be satisfied with nothing short of all
that and it will be well for every girl to learn early in life to pursue only
the paths that will lead into ways wherein these qualities of person and
character may be found. So here and now it is timely to ask of the readers of
these lines&#8212;</p>

ethics must understand that the true spirit of good manners is very closely
allied to that of good morals. It has been pointed out that no stronger proof
of this assertion is required than the fact that the Messiah himself, in his
great moral teachings, so frequently touches upon the <span class=
'sidenote'>The fine art of living, indeed, is to draw from each person his

Whiting</span>.</span> subject of manners. He teaches that modesty is the true

themselves, seldom distinguished for fine manners, did not fail to teach the
importance of them to others. Socrates and Aristotle have left behind them a
code of ethics that might easily be turned into a &quot;Guide to the Complete
Gentleman;&quot; and Lord Bacon has written an essay on manners in which he
reminds <span class='sidenote'>If the day and the night are such that you greet
them with joy, and life emits a fragrance like flowers and sweet-scented

that a stone must be of very high value to do without a setting.</p>
<p>The motive in cultivating good manners should not be shallow and
superficial. Lord Chesterfield says that the motive that makes one wish to be
polite is a desire to shine among his fellows and to raise one&#8217;s self
into a society supposed to be better than his own. It is unnecessary to state
that Lord Chesterfield&#8217;s good manners, fine as they appear, do not bear
the true <span class='sidenote'>Blessings ever wait on virtuous
deeds.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Congreve.</span></span>
stamp of genuineness. There is not the living person back of them possessing
heart and character. They seem to him, in a measure, what a fine gown does to
the wax figure in the dressmaker&#8217;s window. True manners mean more than
<span class='sidenote'>The microscope gives us a world, a universe, a single
drop of dew. So also there is a world in a single profound, earnest
meditation.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Madame
Swetchine.</span></span> mannerisms. They cannot be taught entirely from a book
in which there are sets of rules to be observed on any and every occasion. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
are rather a cultivated method of thinking and feeling and the forming of a
character that knows, intuitively, the nice and kind and appropriate thing to
do without reference to what a printed rule of conduct may set forth.</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>Better is it to have a small portion of good sense,
with humility and a slender understanding, than great treasures of science,
with vain self-complacency.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Thomas
à Kempis.</span></span> It is generally agreed that our best and only right
motive in the cultivation of good manners should be to make ourselves better
than we otherwise would be, to render ourselves agreeable to every one whom we
may meet, and to improve, it may be, the society in which we are placed. With
these objects in view, it is plainly as much a moral duty to cultivate
one&#8217;s manners as it is to cultivate one&#8217;s mind, and no one can deny
that we are better citizens when we observe the nicer amenities of society than
we are when we pay no heed to them.</p>
<p>Lord Bacon says: &quot;Many examples may be put of the force of custom, both
upon <span class='sidenote'>There is one road to peace and that is
truth.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Shelley.</span></span> mind
and body. Therefore, since custom is the principle magistrate of man&#8217;s
life, let men by all means endeavor to obtain good customs. Certainly custom is
most perfect when it beginneth in young years; this we call education, which
is, in effect, but an early custom.&quot; <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id=

characters are but the expression of our habits and of our manners. And we see
that only those habits that are formed in the early years of life seem to fit
us perfectly and naturally throughout all the years.</p>
<p>It is an old saying and a homely one, but none the less true, that &quot;it
is hard to teach an old dog new tricks.&quot; So it is hard to acquire in later
life the manners and graces that escape us in youth.</p>

For if her culture does not in some ways influence and soften and modify her
heart as well as her mind, its true purpose has been lost.</p>

Orison Swett Marden, one of the world&#8217;s wisest of observers and deepest
of philosophers, says, &quot;The world makes way for the determined man.&quot;
And so it does <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name=
'page_146'></a>146</span> <span class='sidenote'>Nothing of worth or weight can
be achieved with half a mind, with a faint heart, and with a lame
endeavor.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Barrow</span>.</span>
for the determined woman, or the determined girl or boy.</p>
<p>Regarding this thing called &quot;Success,&quot; too many of us are apt to
think that it means some one, isolated, remarkable achievement, that comes at
the end of a <span class='sidenote'>Good manners are part of good
morals.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Whately</span>.</span>
long period of striving in some particular field of endeavor. This is not
entirely true. Every great success is made of very many lesser successes that
have preceded it. Just as the cap-stone at the top of the tallest building is
held in its lofty position by every stone beneath it even down to the ones deep
in the earth at the very foundation of the structure, which are indeed perhaps
<span class='sidenote'>After all, the kind of world one carries about within
one&#8217;s self is the important thing, and the world outside takes all its
grace, color and value from that.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Lowell</span>.</span> the most important of all.</p>
<p>So the thing which the world is pleased to call &quot;Success&quot; is built
up by a thousand little successes on which it must finally rest. The building
of a life success begins with the earliest dawn of being and must be carried on
with as much care as a mason would give to the laying of the walls of a
structure designed to stand for years. The mason knows that if he does not lay
his <span class='sidenote'>In character, in manner, in style, in all things the
supreme excellence is simplicity.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Longfellow</span>.</span> foundations deep and firm,
that if the walls are not kept straight and plumb, that if he <span class=
'pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span> puts faulty
bricks or stones in the walls, the building will not be a success. The work at
every stage must be a success or the completed structure must be a failure.</p>
<p>So it is in life. If our moments are not successful, the hours can never be
so, and the days and years can but enlarge upon and emphasize their failure.
&quot;Every day is a fresh beginning, every morn is a world made new,&quot;
says Susan Coolidge. There is a chance for attaining success every hour and day
of our lives.</p>
<p>Success is not alone for the great men of the world who find new continents,

it.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Bovee</span>.</span> explore
the poles, navigate the air, write great poems, paint great pictures, or who
amass fortunes of millions of dollars. No, success is for any and all of us,
here and now, any and all the time.</p>

success.</p>
<p>Have you your music lesson well in hand for this afternoon? If so, that
means success.</p>
<p>Have you been kind to everybody to-day, and with a pleasant word and a

about you? If so, that is a fine moral success. And if you will multiply the
<span class='sidenote'>Not so much beautiful features as a beautiful soul can
make a beautiful face.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Margaret E.
Sangster</span>.</span> achievements of to-day by the days that are in the
years before you, you can see the result that you have a reason to expect, as
your life&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>Success means doing all that we can do as well as we can do it. It may be

individuality.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Joe Mitchell
Chapple</span>.</span> work or it may be play. It may be something of seemingly
little account or it may be something of importance, but unless we do it well,
and to the best of our ability it will not be a success.</p>
<p>&quot;Every day,&quot; says Bunsen, &quot;ought to be begun as a serious
work, standing alone in itself, and yet connected with the past and the
future.&quot; And Ruskin still further emphasizes this thought in the words:
&quot;Let every dawn of morning be to you as the beginning of life, and every
setting sun be to you as its close; then let every one of these short lives
leave its sure record of some <span class='sidenote'>Resolution always gives us
courage.&#8212; <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A. E.
Winship</span>.</span> kindly thing done for others.&quot;</p>
<p>We begin to achieve success when we do the things that are necessary for
such achievement. Huxley expressed the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id=
'page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span> <span class='sidenote'>Of all
fruitless errands, sending a tear to look after a day that has gone is the most
fruitless.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dickens</span>.</span>
whole secret of the matter when he said: &quot;Perhaps the most valuable result
of all education is the ability to make yourself do the thing you have to do,
when it ought to be done, as it ought to be done, whether you like to do it or
not.&quot;</p>
<p>A good life, which is but another name for success, does not come
<span class='sidenote'>You can never be wise unless you love
reading.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Johnson</span>.</span> by
accident. Fortune may seem to favor it but it is the disposition to seize upon
the opportunities that present themselves that make some lives seem more blest
with &quot;good chances&quot; than others.</p>
<p>Self cultivation is the secret of most all attainments in the realm of human
endeavor. As a matter of fact, all that others can do for us is as nothing to

base of all progress and all moral development.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Confucius</span>.</span> that which we may do for
ourselves. Persons who do things usually have to work for results, or they have
at some time had to work to acquire the habits that later on make it seem so
easy for them to do fine things. &quot;We think,&quot; says J. C. Van Dyke,
&quot;because the completed work looks easy or reads easy, that it must have
been done easily. But the geniuses of the world have all put upon record their
conviction that there is more virtue in perspiration than in inspiration. The

poets, whether in print or in paint, have spent their weeks and
months&#8212;yes, years&#8212;composing, adjusting, putting in and taking out.
They have known what it is to &#8217;lick things into shape,&#8217; to labor
and be baffled, to despair and to hope anew.&quot;</p>
<p>With the dawning of every morning, life comes bringing to us a new and

we will. Shall it be a fine, gratifying success, or shall it be a failure?
Shall it be part success and part failure? There can be no doubt about it being

<p>&quot;Every true life,&quot; says J. R. Miller, &quot;should be a perpetual
climbing upward. We should put our faults under our feet, and make them steps
on which to lift ourselves daily a little higher.... We never <span class=

'font-variant: small-caps'>Cranch</span>.</span> there are always other rounds
of the ladder to climb.&quot;</p>
<p>So we know that the purpose of life is not to make a failure of it. And we
know that we cannot make it a success unless we work toward that end. &quot;The
first <span class='sidenote'>People influence us who have no business to do it,
simply because we have neglected to train ourselves to attend to our own
affairs.&#8212;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A. E.
Winship</span>.</span> great rule is, we must do something&#8212;that life must
have a purpose and an aim&#8212;that work should be not merely occasional and
spasmodic, but steady and continuous,&quot; says Lecky. &quot;Pleasure is a
jewel which will retain its luster only when it is in a setting of work, and a
vacant life is one of the worst of pains, though the islands of leisure that
stud a crowded, well-occupied life may be among the things to which we look
back with the greatest delight.&quot;</p>
<p>There can be no interest where there is no purpose. How tiresome it would

life is the aimless life,&quot; says Jenkin Lloyd Jones. &quot;Heaven help the

enhanced with the constantly enlarging sphere of women&#8217;s work. The

of the brilliant achievements women are making everywhere. Indeed, men are

inevitable and makes use of it.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Wendell Phillips</span>.</span> work is being
successfully challenged at every point. So general is this experience becoming
that the present status of things might well be set forth somewhat after the
following style:</p>
<p class='topic'>MAN, POOR MAN!</p>
<p class='poetry'>The question used to be, &#8217;t is
true,<br />
&quot;What tasks are there for girls to do?&quot;<br />
But now we&#8217;ve reached an epoch when<br />

while,<br />
And go completely out of style.</p>
<p>This piece of frivolity can well be pardoned on account of its absurdity.
The great work of the world is so broad, so deep, so high, that it calls for
the best endeavors of all girls and boys, women and men. That the door of
opportunity is henceforth to be open to all is an assurance that the work is to
be more grandly <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name=

most of our failures.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Bovee</span>.</span> and beautifully done than ever
before. What women may do in the years to come is wonderfully set forth by what
women have done in the past. All history is filled with the splendid
achievements of the women of the world. A girl of to-day will find <span class=
'sidenote'>It is generally the idle who complain they cannot find time to do
that which they fancy they wish.&#8212;<span style=
'font-variant: small-caps'>Lubbock</span>.</span>no reading more helpful and
inspiring than the lives of such noble women as Martha Washington, Queen
Victoria, Sally Bush&#8212;Abraham Lincoln&#8217;s good

Franklin, <span class='sidenote'>What ardently we wish we soon

Julia Ward Howe, and Florence Nightingale.</p>
<p>If the girls of to-day are to have larger rewards in the world&#8217;s work,
they must fit themselves for the larger responsibilities. Every prudent girl
will, of course, talk over the prospect of her future years with her parents,
her brothers and sisters, her teachers, or with mature and responsible friends.
So very, very much depends on laying the right foundations. But there are many
qualities that must constitute parts of every enduring foundation. <span class=

Dorr.</span></span> modesty, gentility, enlightenment, all of these and more
are essential to success and for the highest achievement of the true purpose of
living.</p>
<p>It has been well said that it is the repetition of little acts which
constitutes not only the sum of human character, but which determines the
character of nations; and where men or nations have broken down, it will almost
invariably be found that neglect of little things was the rock on which they
were wrecked.</p>
<p>Every human being has duties to be performed, and, therefore, has need of

capacity for doing them&#8212;whether the sphere of action be the management of

nation.</p>

matter of character-building is the fact that steady attention to the little
matters of detail lies at the very foundation of human progress.</p>

relations with the soil and can thus take in the nourishment needed for the
making of growth. This, the larger roots have not the capacity for doing. So in
the growth of the human intellect and human character, it is the little
actions, day by day, that really do the permanent building. With patient
purpose to do successfully the many little tasks that confront us we can later
on achieve the larger success awaiting us.</p>
<p><span class='sidenote'>Many people owe the grandeur of their lives to their

chemist Vanquelin was the son of a peasant; the poet Burns was a farmer boy and
a day laborer; Ben Jonson was a bricklayer; Livingstone, the traveler and
explorer, was a weaver; Abraham Lincoln was a &quot;rail-splitter&quot; and a
farmer boy.</p>
